BREAKTHROUGH

This variation of Breakout features two new rules:
1) Bricks to eliminate are both above and below the paddle, so a ball falling below a paddle no longer causes a loss of life. If the ball touches the electrical middle strip that the paddle is along, your ball is fried and you lose a life.
2) You can let the ball pass through to the other side by pressing Shift when the ball approaches the paddle. This allows you to destroy bricks on the other side.

It also includes a new extended paddle power-up. When this power-up drops, the paddle extends width-wise for 10 seconds.
