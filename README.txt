BREAKTHROUGH
by Judy Trinh

Game Objective: The goal of this game ultimately is to end it by eliminating bricks.
Stay alive for as long as you can; your score will thank you!

This variation of Breakout features a few new rules:
1) Bricks to eliminate are both above and below the paddle, so a ball falling below a paddle no longer causes a loss of life. If the ball touches the electrical middle strip that the paddle is along, however, your ball is fried and you lose a life.
2) You can let the ball pass through to the other side by pressing SHIFT when the ball approaches the paddle. This allows you to destroy bricks on the other side.
3) Bricks have a life span: they continue to respawn until their lives run out (thy have 5 lives). Good luck getting rid of them!

New resource:
It now includes a new extended paddle power-up. When this power-up drops, the paddle extends width-wise for 10 seconds.

New scoring system:
Your score increases as you stay alive. A score multiplier doubles as you stay on the same number of lives. If you lose a life, it resets to x1, decreasing the rate at which your score increases. Also, bonus points for FULLY killing bricks!
